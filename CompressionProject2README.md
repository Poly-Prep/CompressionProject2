# Text File Compression Utility

This Java-based application provides a graphical interface for compressing and decompressing `.txt` files using two different algorithms:

- **Algorithm 2**: A custom frequency-based compression algorithm.
- **Algorithm 3**: An implementation based on Huffman coding principles.

The program is designed for use on macOS systems and only accepts `.txt` files as input and output.

## Features

- Compress and decompress `.txt` files
- Switch between compression and decompression modes
- Select between two compression algorithms
- Maintains original punctuation and capitalization
- Save compressed or decompressed text to a file

## Requirements
